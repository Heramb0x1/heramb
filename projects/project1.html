    <h2><i><b>Home Automation: Revolutionizing the Way We Live, in a nutshell</b></i></h2>
<h6>We â€˜Team TechQuadâ€™ built a project for our recent Electronics Project Based Learning Exhibition!</h6>

<p>Our project showcases how technology can transform daily life through innovative features like :</p>

<p>'MoodE : Mood Based Environment Development'
ðŸŒŸ Leveraging OpenCV, Basic Electronics, and ML libraries, creating a enriching environment for users who are trapped in 9-5 work ethic, or even for hospital patients. Being the major goal we focused on was to create a system (software) which would focus on making the tired, exhausted user feel better, via environment light changing [ on basis of user's mood, which was detected through Haar Cascade (real-time object detection algorithm) ] [ we even tried using MTCNN algorithm, yolo v8 ml libraries, but had computational processing issues], song played in background (feel better centered songs, which will make user feel better), automated perfume scent(which would make user's environment smell with better aroma to make him feel better). ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ¶âœ¨

<b>Future Development:</b>
Developments include refining mood detection algorithms with user feedback, enhancing integration with home automation systems, and exploring AI-based decision-making for personalized user experiences.
