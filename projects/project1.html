    <h2><i><b>Home Automation: Revolutionizing the Way We Live, in a nutshell</b></i></h2>
<p>We â€˜Team TechQuadâ€™ built a project for our recent Electronics Project Based Learning Exhibition!</p>

<p>Our project showcases how technology can transform daily life through innovative features like :</p>

<p>'MoodE : Mood Based Environment Development'
<p>ðŸŒŸ Leveraging OpenCV, Basic Electronics, and ML libraries, creating a enriching environment</br> for users who are trapped in 9-5 work ethic, or even for hospital patients.</br> Being the major goal we focused on was to create a system (software) which would focus </br> on making the tired, exhausted user feel better, via environment </br> light changing [ on basis of user's mood, which was detected through Haar Cascade </br> (real-time object detection algorithm) ] </br> [ we even tried using MTCNN algorithm, yolo v8 ml libraries,</br> but had computational processing issues], song played in background </br>(feel better centered songs, which will make user feel better),</br> automated perfume scent(which would make user's environment smell with better aroma to make him feel better). ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ¶âœ¨</p>

<p><b>Future Development:</b>
Developments include refining mood detection algorithms with user feedback, enhancing integration with </br> home automation systems, and exploring AI-based decision-making </br> for personalized user experiences.
